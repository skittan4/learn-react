## React Elements

Interacting with the DOM can be a frustrating experience. It requires lots of awkward lines of code where you tell the browser _exactly_ how to create an element with the right properties.

```javascript
const title = document.createElement("h1");
title.className = "title";
title.textContent = "Hello world!";
```

This is frustrating because there is a more declarative way to create elements: HTML.

```html
<h1 class="title">Hello world!</h1>
```

Unfortunately we can't use HTML inside JavaScript files. HTML can't create elements dynamically as a user interacts with our app. This is where React comes in:

```jsx
const title = <h1 className="title">Hello world!</h1>;
```

This variable is a _React element_. It's using a special syntax called [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) that lets us write HTML-like elements within our JavaScript.

### Technical sidenote

JSX is _not JavaScript_. It's an extra addon to make writing React elements more like writing HTML. This means browsers don't understand it. React apps use a tool called [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to turn this non-standard syntax into regular JS function calls that the browser can run.

The example above will be transformed into:

```javascript
const title = React.createElement("h1", { className: "title" }, "Hello world!");
```

This function call will return an object that describes your element:

```javascript
// over-simplified for examples sake
const title = {
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    className: "title",
    children: "Hello world!",
  },
};
```

React builds up one big tree structure of all these element objects that represents your entire app. It then uses this tree to create the actual DOM elements for you. (This is called the [virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html), but you don't need to worry about that right now)

It can be helpful to remember that the HTML-like syntax is really normal function calls that return objects.

### Important warning

Since JSX is closer to JS than HTML **we have to use the camelCase versions of HTML attributes**: `class` becomes `className`, `for` becomes `htmlFor` and `tabindex` becomes `tabIndex` etc.

Also self-closing tags (like `<img>`) must have a closing slash: `<img />`. This is optional in HTML but required in JSX.

## Templating dynamic values

JSX supports interpolating dynamic values into your elements. It uses a similar syntax to JS template literals: anything inside curly brackets will be evaluated as a JS expression, and the _result_ will be rendered. For example:

```jsx
const title = <h1>Hello {5 * 5}</h1>;
// <h1>Hello 25</h1>
```

You can do all kinds of JS stuff inside the curly brackets, like referencing other variables, or conditional expressions.

```jsx
const name = "oli";
const title = <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
// <h1>Hello oli</h1>
```

```jsx
const number = Math.random();
const result = <div>{number > 0.5 ? "You won!" : "You lost"}</div>;
// 50% of the time: <div>You won!</div>
// the other 50%: <div>You lost</div>
```

### Note on expressions

You can put any valid JS _expression_ inside the curly brackets. An expression is code that _resolves to a value_. I.e. you can assign it to a variable. These are all valid expressions:

```js
const number = 5 + 4 * 9;
const isEven = number % 2 === 0;
const message = isEven ? "It is even" : "It is odd";
```

This is _not_ a valid expression:

```js
const message = if (isEven) 
{ "It is even" } else { "It is odd" };
// this is not valid JS and will cause an error
```



`if` blocks are _statements_, not expressions. The main impact of this is that you have to use ternaries instead of `if` statements inside JSX.
